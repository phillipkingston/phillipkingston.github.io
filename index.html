    <h3>Opus: A Large Work Model for Complex Workflow Generation</h3>
    <p>This paper introduces Opus, a novel framework for generating and optimizing Workflows tailored to complex Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) use cases, focusing on cost reduction and quality enhancement while adhering to established industry processes and operational constraints. Our approach generates executable Workflows from Intention, defined as the alignment of Client Input, Client Output, and Process Context. These Workflows are represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), with nodes as Tasks consisting of sequences of executable Instructions, including tools and human expert reviews. We adopt a two-phase methodology: Workflow Generation and Workflow Optimization. In the Generation phase, Workflows are generated using a Large Work Model (LWM) informed by a Work Knowledge Graph (WKG) that encodes domain-specific procedural and operational knowledge. In the Optimization phase, Workflows are transformed into Workflow Graphs (WFGs), where optimal Workflows are determined through path optimization. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in reliably retrieving detailed process data as well as generating industry-compliant workflows. The key contributions of this paper include integrating a Work Knowledge Graph (WKG) into a Large Work Model (LWM) to enable the generation of context-aware, semantically aligned, structured and auditable Workflows. It further introduces a two-phase approach that combines Workflow Generation from Intention with graph-based Workflow Optimization. Finally, we present Opus Alpha 1 Large and Opus Alpha 1 Small that outperform state-of-the-art LLMs by 38% and 29% respectively in Workflow Generation for a Medical Coding use case.</p>
